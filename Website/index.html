	<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">What if...</h1>
	<h2 style="text-align:left;">--------------------------------------</h2>
	<p style="font-family:courier;"> What if you take the chance, what if you risk your heart,<br> what if you crash it into someone who genuinely inspires you,<br>and they choose you? What if they love you the way you always desired to be loved? <br>What if they make you breakfast in bed on Sundays, <br>and hug your broken pieces back together,<br> and bring you soup when you're sick, and fill your life with the sunniest,<br>most tender kind of happiness? What if they grow you,<br> and encourage you, and teach you that love was always meant to be soft?<br> That it was always meant to feel the way it feels when you are with them? <br>What if they make you understand why it never worked out with anyone who came before them?</p>
    
    <h3 style="font-family:verdana;"> What if they stay? </h3>
